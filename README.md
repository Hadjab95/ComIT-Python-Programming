My Python Journey at Comit.

ALGORITHMS 1
1) What is a problem? Is it important to describe the context in which I am to solve it? How do you call the facts that
we enunciate to complete the understanding of the problem? Is the problem the same for all people who analyze it?
Why?
In general, a problem is a situation that must be dealt with or overcome in order for a person to achieve a goal or
desired outcome. It is important to describe the context of a problem in order to solve it since the context will provide
the tools and information that may be available to you. When writing an algorithm to solve a problem, we store the
facts as we understand them as data in variables or we document them as comments within our algorithm logic. A
problem will not always be the same as all people who analyze it since they may view it from a different context.
2) List the steps required to resolve the following situations:
 Prepare and eat a fried egg.
 Rent and watch a movie.
 Go to a movie at the theater.
Preparing an egg: Find frying pan. Place frying pan on burner. Turn on heat. Open fridge. Get Eggs. Get butter. Put
butter in pan. Wait until butter melts. Crack egg open and drop contents into pan. Wait until egg starts to cook on top
surface. Turn off smoke alarm that went off because the burner you used was dirty. Return to egg. Dump contents of
pan into garbage because they burned while smoke alarm went off. Repeat previous steps until out of eggs or out of
butter. Go to Denny’s breakfast restaurant. Oder a single fried egg. Wait for order. Put egg in mouth when it arrives.
Chew egg. Shallow Egg. End of algorithm.
I’m not going to go through the other questions, you know how to do this.
3) Explain the steps you normally take to solve a problem.
Break the problem down into a number of high level sub-problems. For each sub-problem, break them down into
smaller sub problems. Continue into you have a set of easy to solve sub-problems, and then work your way up the
problem tree by generating solutions for the sub-problems.
4) A man found to fly in his coffee and sent his coffee back to the kitchen. When the waiter returned with a new cup
of coffee, the man took a sip and immediately knew that the waiter had just removed the fly and given him back the
same cup of coffee. How did the man know that he was not served a fresh cup of coffee?
If the coffee had been sweetened, he would sip the coffee and know that it was not fresh if it was still sweet. This is
an example of being able to solve a problem by knowing more of the context. Context is important!
5) Some months have 31 days, others have 30, how many have 28?
All of them. Every month has 28 days. Some just continue on after reaching 28. Ha!
6) A man is trapped in a room. The room has only two possible exits: two doors. Through the first door there is a
room constructed from magnifying glass. The blazing hot sun instantly fries anything or anyone that enters. Through
the second door there is a fire-breathing dragon. How does the man escape?
He waits until night time and walks through the first door.
